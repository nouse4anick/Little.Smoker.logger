Little.Smoker.logger
====================

Raspberry Pi based data logger for my steam boat, SL Little Smoker.

Project requirements:
- raspberry pi
- 5v power supply
- a gps module
- temp sensor (rated to 550-600 degF or better)
- pressure sensor (prefer steam rated but as long as its rated for over 80C it should work)
- tach reading (motor already installed, maybe use arduino and other sensor?)
- A/D converter (maybe use ardino?)
- analisis software (probably webpage based, use google maps library for mapping and plotting of data points.

Phases:
- 1: get the pi to turn off when button is pressed (completed)
- 2: data logging with gps unit (inprogress)
- 3: integration with temp and pressure sensors (pending)
- 4: calibration and testing (possible land testing with test engines and boiler) (pending)
- 5: actual run (pending)
